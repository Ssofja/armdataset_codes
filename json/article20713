According to him, a new benchmark in the system of public administration must be set, which implies better services for the population.\nIn response, outgoing Chief of Staff Eduard Aghajanyan thanked the PM for his trust. ‘It is obvious that we went through difficult days together, but we can state that we have definitely overcome those difficult days with honor,’ former Chief of Staff said.\nProsecutors are under government’s influence - Armenian ex-president’s defence \nArmenia’s ex-President Robert Kocharyan, who was in power from 1998 to 2008, appeared in a Yerevan Court on Monday to attend another hearing over an alleged criminal case on ‘overthrowing the constitutional order’.\nKocharyan’s defence filed a motion for recusal of the Prosecutors arguing that they are under the influence of the government, since PM Pashinyan can invite the Prosecutors any time and discuss the process of criminal cases which is against the legal norms, Sputnik Armenia reports.\nAs Panorama.am reports, dozens of citizens gathered outside the court building for a protest with posters, reading ‘Authorities who sold Shushi versus Heroes who liberated Shushi’.  \nIn 2008 when Kocharyan’s ally Serzh Sargsyan was elected the next president, massive public protests started disputing the results of the elections. Eight protesters and two police officers were killed as a result of clashes and violent actions by the police. According to Armenia’s Special Investigation Service, Kocharyan and his team used military units against protesters. Nikol Pashinyan, who was one of the organisers of the protesters and Armenia’s 1st president Levon Ter-Petrosyan’s ally in 2008, was arrested and spent two years in prison.\nKocharyan, who left politics in 2008 and immersed into business in Moscow, where he has an extensive network, was detained in 2018 in Yerevan. Kocharyan denied the accusations calling them an act of political revenge. He was released in 2020 on more than a $4M bail which, according to his lawyers, is ‘unprecedented’ in Armenia.\nSeyran Ohanyan, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in 2008, general Yuri Khachaturov, a former CSTO secretary-general who served as Deputy Minister of Defense in 2008, and former Secretary of the Security Council Armen Gevorgyan were also charged over the same criminal case.\nOther news from Armenia\n\nForeign Defence Ministry Seyran Ohanyan said that the January 11 meeting between Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Russian leaders did not resolve the challenges the Armenian side has been faced, including the issue of PoWs, am reports. Ohanyan, who participated in both the first and second wars in Nagorno Karabakh, added that the leadership in Armenia easily falls under the influence of Azerbaijan, and therefore they need to be replaced with someone with a firm hand. Ohanyan also expressed his doubts over the benefits of unblocking regional transport connections saying that this will be followed by aggressive economic pressure by Azerbaijan and Turkey and attempts by them to drastically change the demographic situation in Armenia.\nOpposition Bright Armenia party leader Edmon Marukyan said today that amid a severe political crisis, the Armenian government impedes the consultations, seizes the position of the head of NA Standing committee from the opposition, and declares that the most prominent challenge for the country is the parliamentary elections.
