In the lawyer’s words, considering that there is a state-level anti-Armenian policy, containing hatred, the Armenian side can directly seek international judicial protection.\nAdditional evidence of deeply rooted hatred and enmity toward Armenians in Azerbaijan was presented on Monday by the Armenian Human Rights Defender Arman Tatoyan. The Ombudsman published a list of posts spreading Armenophobia by real users of Azerbaijani social media copying the statements by Azerbaijani authorities and cultural figures. The posts contain hatred expressed in calls on torturing and killing Armenian women and children, slogans such as ‘The best Armenian is a dead Armenian’ and citing Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev’s statement about ‘driving away Armenians like dogs’. ‘The same words are used by the Azerbaijani military in videos of torture and inhumane treatment of Armenians,’ the Ombudsman said.\nEarlier Human Rights Defenders of Armenia and Artsakh published a special report with the results of the monitoring carried out during the September-November war.\nOpposition condemns reported appointment of Armenian Ambassador to U.S.\nThe head of the ruling My Step parliamentary group Lilit Makunts has confirmed in her interview with RFE/RL Armenian Service that her possible appointment as Armenian Ambassador to the United States is under discussion.\nMakunts, 37, a former English teacher, started her political career after the Revolution in Armenia in 2018 when she was appointed as Armenia’s Minister of Culture.\nAfter the media reports over her possible appointment as Armenia’s envoy to the U.S. was spread, a number of representatives of the opposition and Diaspora representatives condemned a possible decision of her appointment.\nNaira Zohrabyan of the opposition ‘Prosperous Armenia’ party called the possible decision a ‘disaster’ saying that knowledge of English is not enough to work as a professional diplomat. ‘A woman who only speaks English will be appointed ambassador in one of the most important countries, which co-chairs OSCE Minsk group,’ the opposition MP said.\n‘With the stakes so high and the need for serious, seasoned professionals so very clear, we cannot afford on-the-job-training, political sinecures, or anything other than our very best in high-level diplomatic postings,’ Armenian National Committee of America reacted as RFE/RL Armenian Service reports.\nThe ruling party lawmaker responded to the critics by saying that while the experience is extremely important, in some cases it does not play a priority role. According to her, there is no limitation for a political appointment of an ambassador as an alternative to a diplomatic appointment.\nArmenian FM discusses protection of historical heritage with UNESCO head \nArmenian Foreign Minister Ara Ayvazian had a telephone conversation with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.
