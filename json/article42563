He added that integration within Eurasian Economic Union is much deeper, interesting, and broader than that of the Commonwealth of Independent Countries (CIS).\nSpeaking about the recent Nagorno Karabakh war, Kocharyan said that if he were in power, there would be no war. ‘This was a well-planned information attack, the start of hostilities, and it was obvious that [Azerbaijan] had been prepared for this for a long time,’ Kocharyan said adding that if he were in power a total mobilization of resources would stop Azerbaijan.  \n‘I have returned to big politics,’ Kocharyan said adding: ‘We now feel a great demand for predictable, perceivable, and strong individuals.’  According to him, the next elections will be a choice between the current government and the forces that oppose it.\n‘People tasted the fruit of populism, the consequences of colourful revolutions and the work of inexperienced people,’ Kocharyan said adding that it is time for professional leaders and people with will, who are able to tell the truth to their opponents.\n‘None of the presidents of Armenia had the power that the prime minister has today,’ said Kocharyan stating his preference for a presidential system of governance as a better way to balance the interests of political forces. According to him, if the PM’s ruling party did not have an absolute majority, the situation in Armenia would be completely different.\nKocharyan described the defeat in the war as a whole series of wrong decisions and failures in diplomacy that brought the negotiations to a deadlock.  In his words, these are the consequences of those who came to power from the street without any experience in politics and knowledge in geopolitics, and those who only care about the number of likes on Facebook.\nIn Kocharyan’s words, there are similarities between Nikol Pashinyan and Alexei Navalny distinguished by the past, technologies, lack of experience, and talent to manipulate people. Kocharyan called the emergence of such people an anti-systematic trend nurtured by the Internet and social networks.\nFamilies of missing servicemen protest in front of Ministry of Defence\nFamilies of those missing as a consequence of the recent Nagorno Karabakh war held a protest rally in front of the Ministry of Defence, Armenpress.am reports.\nThe protesters said they demand a meeting with Minister Vagharshak Harutyunyan to have answers to their questions about their missing family members and relatives.\nEarlier on Friday, Armenian Human Rights Defender Arman Tatoyan had a meeting with the Head of the EU Delegation to Armenia, Ambassador Andrea Wiktorin. The parties discussed the issue of the urgent return of Armenian servicemen and civilians captures by Azerbaijan. Tatoyan noted that the Azerbaijani authorities artificially delay the return of the captives to cause mental suffering to the families of the captives and to the Armenian society.\nProvision 8 of the Moscow-brokered truce statement ending war between Armenian and Azerbaijan, provides for the immediate return of captives.  Earlier the Armenian Ombudsman made a statement saying that Azerbaijan misreports the real numbers of the captives which goes against the international humanitarian law and violates the rights of the family members of the captives. He added that Azerbaijan, which abuses legal proceedings, started prosecution against the PoWs using detention as a punishment.\nOther news from Armenia\nArmenian Foreign Minister Ara Ayvazyan and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov discussed issues of regional security and stability by phone on Saturday, Hetq.am reports.\nMinisters Ayvazyan and Lavrov, according to a statement released by Ayvazyan's office, discussed the full implementation of the provisions of the November 9 trilateral statement.  \nAyvazyan emphasized the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in Artsakh on the spot.\nArmenian Ministry of Emergency Situations informed that in the coming days the seismic activity will continue in Armenia.
