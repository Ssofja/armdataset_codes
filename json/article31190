    "text": "Օfficial representative of the \"Armenia\" alliance's central headquarters Aram Vardevanyan issued a statement.\n\"A few minutes ago, Nikol Pashinyan, the PM candidate of the \"Civil Contract\", using his social status as the acting Prime Minister, made a statement on his official Facebook page. Doing so, he called for \"unconditional\" participation in the voting. First, he violated the principle of the day of silence. Second, using his status, that is the service dependence of the executive bodies, urged them to take part in the voting, in the conditions where he is a PM candidate of one of the 26 forces. This was direct propaganda using administrative leverages, and allegedly undertaking the function of the CEC. We consider that the CEC should immediately convene a session to investigate this significant violation of the legitimacy of the electoral process based on this statement,\" the statement reads.\n"
